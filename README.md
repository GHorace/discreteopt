# discreteopt
Discrete optimization algorithms. For each of the three famous problems here, 5 examples are provided to test discrete optimization algorithms efficiency (at least their implementation...).  

## 1. Shortest paths
To launch a task solver, type in command line "python get_shortest_paths.py task1_test[k].txt" with [k] as the number of the sample used.

## 2. Knapsack
To solve the instance, do "python knapsack.py task2_test[k].txt"

## 3. Traveling salesman problem
If you have time to kill, just launch "python tsp.py task3_test[k].txt" :)
